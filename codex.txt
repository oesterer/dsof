application that renders the stars of the night sky depending on the users location.

add Overlay constellations

add a grid for Ascension and Declination

Add optional constellation labels or tooltips so users can identify each shape and star.
  Add small RA/Dec labels around the edge so users can read values directly.
  Introduce finer grid granularity or user-configurable spacing for advanced observers.
  Add Messier objects and use different icons for each type of messier object.

allow the user to change the direction of the view with the mouse
  add an option to zoom in
  add a yellow line visualizing the horizon
  add a green line visualizing the ecliptic

add moon and planets. use colorful icons for the planets. Show the phases of the moon.

allow the user to change both view angles with mouse drags

rename project and page from "Night Sky Viewer" to "Deep Sky Object Finder"

add all stars from the yale bright star catalog

add a magnitude filter option to only show brighter stars

render 360 degrees of the sky, not just the visible hemisphere

redo the horizon line algorithm, it does not render as a full circle

The horizon circle does not rotate when the view is rotated

add all Messier objects. See https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/explore-the-night-sky/hubble-messier-catalog/


add all 88 constellations

constellations are not visible

remove zenith label and icon
  increase ability to zoom in, limit zoom out to 180 degrees or full circle
  make grid lines a bit more visible

change zoom range to 1-10

add ability to find object (planet, messier, constellation, star)  by name and center view on object

show image of real messier object in Messier tooltips

use the images on this page for the messier tooltip images instead:   https://astropixels.com/messier/messiergallery.html

  Download them and add them to a folder in the project


show image of real planets in Plantets and Moon tooltips. use the images on this page for the planets and moon tooltip images:
  https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/planets/

  Download them and add them to a folder in the project

 use this image for the moon instead: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/FullMoon2010.jpg/330px-
  FullMoon2010.jpg

add a toolptop image for the sun as well and store locally. use this image: https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/gallery-sun/en/solar-
  flare.en.jpg

change the "Max star magnitude" input to a slider (like zoom)

add a slider to allow the user to advance time up to 24 hours into the future
